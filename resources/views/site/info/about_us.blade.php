                <p>CAFÉ ODEBRECHT was founded in 1956 by Mr. Edmundo Odebrecht (1909 - 1978) in Londrina – Paraná, Brazil. The company was one of the first beneficiaries of the product in the northern region of Paraná, where it had the largest coffee plantations in the world at the time.
                <br>During its long history, this venture has earned the trust and respect of its customers, thanks to a trajectory guided by the suitability and concern with the quality of the product offered.</p>
                <p>More than 60 years after its foundation, ODEBRECHT is a solid company, currently among the 10 largest roasted and ground coffee companies in Brazil and the first in the southern region, exporting its products to more than 20 countries in the world.</p>
                <p>ODEBRECHT currently has a wide and important infrastructure: 3 roasted coffee industries, 3 units for green coffee standardization, 3 laboratories in its units for the measurement and control of products and 1 production unit of chocolate and other products, both strategically located in the main producing regions of the country that supply the national and international market.</p>
                <p>The required quality of ODEBRECHT products extends from coffee purchase to shipment, through modern process of processing and reprocessing of the products, which have made the company one of the most traditional coffee suppliers in Brazil, recognized nationally and internationally as a safe and reliable source of the best coffees in Brazil.</p>
                <p>Our purpose is to serve customers exceeding expectations, seeking total satisfaction about the business done.</p>
                <p>In addition, the search for self-sufficiency in thermal energy is a goal to be achieved. Currently, ODEBRECHT design to remove 2 to 4 times the amount of plastic that our products put in it.</p>
                <p>In ODEBRECHT agricultural production areas, we have a special concern with environmental preservation areas, as well as with legal reserves predefined by law. Our production unit of roasted and ground coffee is located today in a privileged area defined by law as the "Gastronomic and Cultural Zone of Londrina".</p>
