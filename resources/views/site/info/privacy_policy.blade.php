                    <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                    <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.</p>

                    <h3>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</li>

                    <p>By using the Site, you (the visitor, the user) agree to allow third parties to process your IP address, in order to determine your location for the purpose of currency conversion. You also agree to have that currency stored in a session cookie in your browser (a temporary cookie which gets automatically removed when you close your browser). We do this in order for the selected currency to remain selected and consistent when browsing the Site so that the prices can convert to your (the visitor, the user) local currency.</p>
