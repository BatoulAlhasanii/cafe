                    <h2>The Legend of Coffee</h2>
                    <p>There is no real evidence about the discovery of coffee, but there are many legends that report its possible origin.</p>
                    <p>One of the most accepted and disseminated is that of Pastor Kaldi, who lived in Absinia, now Ethiopia, about a thousand years ago. It says that Kaldi noticed that his goats were cheerful and bouncy, and this extra energy was evident whenever they chewed the reddish-yellow fruits of the bushes in some grazing fields.</p>
                    <p>The shepherd noticed that the fruits were a source of joy and motivation, and only with their help could the flock walk for several kilometers by endless climbs.</p>
                    <p>Kaldi commented on the behavior of the animals to a monk in the region, who decided to experience the power of the fruits. The monk took some of the fruit and took it with him to the monastery. He began to use the fruits in the form of infusion, realizing that the drink helped him resist sleep while praying or in his long hours of reading the breviary. This discovery spread rapidly among the monasteries, creating a demand for the drink. Evidence shows that the coffee was first grown in Islamic monasteries in Yemen.</p>

                    <h2>The First Coffee Crops</h2>
                    <p>Coffee plant is originally from Ethiopia, central Africa, where it is still part of the natural vegetation. Arabia was responsible for the spread of coffee culture. The name coffee does not originate from Kaffa, the plant's place of origin, but from the Arabic word “Qahwa”.</p>
                    <p>The oldest manuscripts mentioning the coffee culture date from 575 in Yemen, where, consumed as fresh fruit, it is now cultivated. Only in the sixteenth century, in Persia, the first coffee beans were roasted to become the drink we know today.</p>
                    <p>Coffee became of great importance to the Arabs, who had complete control over the cultivation and preparation of the drink. At that time, coffee was a product kept under the Arabs. It was forbidden for foreigners to approach plantations, and Arabs protected the seedlings with their own lives. The coffee seed off the parchment does not sprout, so only in these conditions could the seeds leave the country.</p>
                    <p>From 1615 the café began to be enjoyed in the European Continent, brought by travelers on their frequent trips to the east. Until the 17th century, only Arabs produced coffee. Germans, French and Italians desperately sought a way to develop planting in their colonies. But it was the Dutch who got the first seedlings and cultivated them in the greenhouses of the Botanical Garden of Amsterdam, a fact that made the drink one of the most consumed in the old continent, becoming a definitive part of the habits of Europeans.</p>
                    <p>From these plants, the Dutch started in 1699, experimental plantations in Java. This successful experience has brought profit, encouraging other countries to try the same. Europe marveled at coffee as a decorative plant, while the Dutch expanded the cultivation to Sumatra, and the French, presented with a coffee foot by the burgomaster of Amsterdam, began testing on the islands of Sandwich and Bourbon.</p>
                    <p>With the Dutch and French experiments, coffee cultivation was taken to other European colonies. The growing European consumer market has led to the expansion of coffee plantations in African countries and their arrival in the New World. At the hands of European settlers, coffee arrived in Suriname, São Domingos, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Guyana. It was through the Guianas that he arrived in northern Brazil. In this way, the secret of the Arabs spread to every corner of the world.</p>

                    <h2>The Coffee Shops</h2>
                    <p>Coffee definitively entered Europe from 1615, brought from the Arab countries by Italian merchants. The habit of drinking coffee, especially in Venice, was associated with social gatherings and music that took place in the cheerful Botteghe Del Caffè.</p>
                    <p>The coffee shops developed in Europe during the 17th century, while the Enlightenment flourished, and the French Revolution was planned. For whole afternoons, young people gathered around several cups of coffee, discussing the fate of nations, declaiming poems, reading books, or simply passing the time. Today, some famous houses such as Café Procope in Paris and Café Florian in Venice still preserve the glamour of that era.</p>

                    <p>Reed approached the wife of the governor of Cayenne, capital of French Guiana, managing to win his trust. Thus, a small seedling of Arabica coffee was offered clandestinely and brought hidden in the luggage of this Brazilian.</p>
                    <p>Under favorable conditions the culture was initially established in the Paraíba River Valley, starting in 1825 a new economic cycle in the country. At the end of the 18th century, Haiti's coffee production -- until then the world's leading exporter of the product -- went into crisis due to the country's long war of independence against France. Taking advantage of this situation, Brazil significantly increased its production and, although still on a small scale, began to export the product more regularly. The shipments were made for the first time in 1779, with the insignificant amount of 79 arrobas. In 1806 alone, exports reached a more significant volume of 80,000 arrobas.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>For almost a century, coffee was the great Brazilian wealth, and the currencies generated by the coffee economy accelerated the development of Brazil and inserted it in international trade relations. The coffee culture occupied valleys and mountains, enabling the emergence of cities and the urbanization of important urban centers throughout the interior of the State of São Paulo, south of Minas Gerais and northern Paraná. Railroads were built to allow the flow of production, replacing animal transport and boosting interregional trade in other important goods. Coffee brought large contingents of immigrants, consolidated the expansion of the middle class, diversification of investments and even intensified cultural movements. From then on, coffee and the Brazilian people are inseparable.</p>
                    <p>The wealth flowed through the Cafezais, evidenced in the elegant mansions of the farmers, who brought European culture to the theaters erected in the new cities of the interior of São Paulo. For ten decades Brazil has grown, driven by the habit of coffee, served in half-world meals, internalizing our culture, building factories, promoting racial miscegenation, dominating political parties, overthrowing the monarchy and abolishing slavery.</p>
                    <p>Besides being the source of many of Brazilian riches, coffee allowed some extraordinary feats. For a long time, the best-known Brazilian coffee in the world was the Santos type. The quality of Santista coffee and the fact that it is one of the main exporting ports of the product, determined the creation of Café Tipo Santos.</p>
                    <p>Implanted with minimal knowledge of the culture, in regions that later became inadequate for its cultivation, coffee growing in south-central Brazil began to have problems in 1870, when a great frost hit the plantations of western São Paulo causing incalculable damage.</p>
                    <p>After a long crisis, the national coffee industry reorganized and producers, industrialists and exporters returned to feed hopes for a better future. The search for the ideal region for coffee culture has spread throughout the country, establishing itself today in regions of the State of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Espírito Santo, Bahia and Rondônia. Coffee continues today, to be one of the most important products for Brazil and is undoubtedly the most Brazilian of all. Today the country is the first producer and the second world consumer of the product.</p>

                    <h2>The path of Coffee Cultivation in Brazil</h2>
                    <p>The first planting occurred in 1727, in Pará. Due to its climatic conditions, coffee cultivation spread rapidly.</p>
                    <p>The starting point of the great plantations was Rio de Janeiro, with the Tijuca forests becoming large coffee plantations. The coffee extends to Angra dos Reis, Parati and arrived in São Paulo by Ubatuba. In a short time, the Paraíba River valley became the great region producing coffee plantations in Brazil. This region with excellent altitude and climate for cultivation, allowed the emergence of a centralizing area of crops and population. Rising up the river, the café invaded the eastern part of the province of São Paulo and the border region of Minas Gerais. At the time, Rio de Janeiro was the port of product outflow and financial center.</p>
                    <p>However, coffee culture in areas with a steep slope and total carelessness regarding soil preservation generated an intense erosion. For this reason, the land was quickly exhausted and the coffee culture migrated to another location, the west of the province of São Paulo, centralizing in Campinas and extending to Ribeirão Preto.</p>
                    <p>Campinas became the great producer pole of the country. The crops stretched out on large uniform surfaces, covering the landscape to lose sight of, forming the famous "coffee seas". In the region, the Cafezais suffered less from soil depletion by the flat surface of the region, which also facilitated communication and transport and provided a concentration of wealth. While a complex system of railway roads was established in the Paraíba Valley, a good network of road and rail roads was established in this new region. With this new producer pole, the coffee changed its distribution center, being all the production of the west of São Paulo and then exported from the port of Santos.</p>

                    <p>Coffee growing in south-central Brazil faced problems in 1870, when a great frost hit plantations in western São Paulo causing great damage, and later during the crisis of 1929. However, after recovering from the crises, the region remained an important producing center. Four producing states stand out: Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Espírito Santo and Paraná. As the search for the ideal region for coffee culture covered the entire country, Bahia has established itself as a producing pole in the Northeast and Rondônia in the North region.</p>

                    <h2>The Great Coffee Farms</h2>
                    <p>The coffee plantations were founded on large monocultural properties worked by slaves, later replaced by salaried workers: the large coffee farms.</p>
                    <p>These farms became famous for their typical architecture and equipment. Tanks in which the grain is washed soon after harvest, terraces for drying, selection and processing machines are part of this environment. The slave Slave Senzala or free-working colonies finalize the characterization of coffee farms. The coffee farm, from the seed to the cup, was a small world, almost isolated.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The development of coffee production was closely related to the amount of manpower available. To encourage coffee production, the administration of the State of São Paulo made the immigration issue the central project of its activities, establishing a system that offered formal assistance to European immigration, especially the Italian one. Through a program that handled advertising in their country of origin, immigrants were brought from their homes in Europe to the coffee farm. Immigration has helped to conquer areas not yet explored, allowing rapid development of the State of São Paulo.</p>
                    <p>With the immigrant workforce the culture gained momentum and for three quarters of a century, almost all of the country's wealth has focused on coffee farming. Brazil dominated 70% of the world's production and dictated the rules of the market. At that time coffee farmers became the social and political elite, forming one of the last Brazilian aristocracies. The opulence of coffee planters allowed the construction of large and beautiful mansions of farms and mansions in the city of São Paulo and financed industrialization in the southeast of the country.</p>

                    <h2>Brazilian Coffee Today</h2>
                    <p>Currently Brazil is the world's largest producer of coffee, accounting for 30% of the international market, a volume equivalent to the sum of production of the other six largest producing countries. It is also the second consumer market, behind only the United States.</p>
                    <p>The coffee areas are concentrated in the south-central part of the country, where four producing states stand out: Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Espírito Santo and Paraná. The Northeast region also has plantations in Bahia, and from the North region there is Rondônia.</p>
                    <p>Arabica coffee production is concentrated in São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Bahia and part of Espírito Santo, while Robusta coffee is planted mainly in Espírito Santo and Rondônia.</p>
